# CNN web 3d visualization

An interactive 3d visualization of a convolutional neural network which runs in your browser and displays reactions to input in real time.

The aim of this project is to demistify and teach the inner workings of CNNs in a way which no other website currently offers.

## Technology

This project leverages WebGL technology through:
